    This program is to take the input of what is in the register (each bill and change) and caculates how much over or under the target amount for the day.
If a day has been missed in the past, the user will be able to add the data in and save the file by the date. Once the inital information has been added 
and all the registers have been inputed a report is generated automatically to be reviewed and/or saved. The user is also able to view any previously saved
reports. The user can select to either pick the current day's report or input a date of a previously saved report and it will pull up the detailed report 
that was saved.
